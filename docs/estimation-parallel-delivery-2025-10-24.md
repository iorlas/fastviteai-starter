# Project Estimation: Environ.jp MedusaJS Migration
## Parallel Delivery Strategy

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Project:** Environ.jp E-Commerce Platform Migration
**Duration:** 33 weeks (7.6 months)
**Delivery Model:** 2-Stream Parallel Delivery (High-Risk vs Low-Risk)
**Team Size:** 6-7 people (ramping from 3 to 7 during build phase)

---

## Executive Summary

### Timeline Overview

| Phase | Duration | Calendar Weeks | Team Size |
|-------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| **POC & Validation** | 3 weeks | Week 1-3 | 2-3 (contract expert + DevOps) |
| **Build Phase** | 25 weeks | Week 4-28 | 6-7 (2 streams running parallel) |
| **Migration** | 5 weeks | Week 29-33 | 7 (full team) |
| **Total** | **33 weeks** | **7.6 months** | Variable |

### Key Estimation Principles

1. **Parallel Delivery:** 2 independent streams maximize velocity and hit 7-month build target
2. **Risk-Based Prioritization:** Stream 1 tackles critical unknowns early (payments, NetSuite)
3. **Strategic Buffers:** +2 weeks NetSuite, +1 week payments, +1 week migration
4. **Critical Path Tracking:** Weekly checkpoints ensure Stream 1 stays on schedule
5. **Resource Flexibility:** Cross-functional teams reduce dependencies between streams

### Total Effort Breakdown

| Category | Person-Weeks | Percentage |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| Backend Development | 98 weeks | 44% |
| Frontend Development | 52 weeks | 23% |
| DevOps & Infrastructure | 18 weeks | 8% |
| QA & Testing | 24 weeks | 11% |
| Migration & Training | 16 weeks | 7% |
| Project Management | 15 weeks | 7% |
| **Total** | **223 person-weeks** | **100%** |

### Budget Estimate

**Assumptions:**
- Average fully-loaded rate: $100/hour (mix of senior/mid-level engineers)
- 40-hour work week

| Phase | Person-Weeks | Hours | Cost @ $100/hr |
|-------|--------------|-------|----------------|
| POC (with contract expert) | 8 weeks | 320 hrs | $48,000 |
| Build Phase | 200 weeks | 8,000 hrs | $800,000 |
| Migration Phase | 15 weeks | 600 hrs | $60,000 |
| **Total Labor** | **223 weeks** | **8,920 hrs** | **$908,000** |
| Infrastructure (AWS) | - | - | $12,000 |
| Third-party services | - | - | $15,000 |
| **Grand Total** | - | - | **$935,000** |

**Note:** This excludes client Python engineer (provided by client), post-launch support, and assumes team is hired at market rates.

## Estimation Methodology

### Techniques Used

1. **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Decomposed project into 80+ tasks
2. **Three-Point Estimation:** Optimistic, pessimistic, most likely for high-risk items
3. **Historical Data:** MedusaJS case studies, similar migration projects
4. **Expert Judgment:** Contract MedusaJS specialist consulted for POC estimates
5. **Analogous Estimation:** Compared to previous Rails → Node.js migrations
6. **Bottom-Up Estimation:** Task-level estimates rolled up to phases

### Estimation Confidence

|-------|------------------|-----------|
| POC | HIGH (±10%) | Well-defined scope, 3 weeks |
| Foundation | HIGH (±15%) | Standard setup, proven patterns |
| NetSuite | MEDIUM (±30%) | External dependency, unknown data quality |
| Payments | MEDIUM (±25%) | Dual gateway unproven, +1 week buffer |
| Stream 2 | HIGH (±15%) | Independent work, clear scope |

## Delivery Confidence Statement

**Overall Assessment:** FEASIBLE with MEDIUM-HIGH confidence

**Why This Estimation is Realistic:**

1. **Based on Research:** MedusaJS technical research identified 17+ weeks custom integration work, which fits our 25-week build timeline with parallelization
2. **Strategic Buffers:** +2 weeks NetSuite, +1 week payments, +1 week migration = 4 weeks buffer on highest-risk items
3. **Proven Pattern:** 2-stream parallel delivery used successfully in similar migrations
4. **Validation Upfront:** 3-week POC de-risks platform choice BEFORE committing team/budget
5. **Resource Flexibility:** 91% utilization leaves 9% capacity for unknowns
6. **Clear Checkpoints:** Week 3, 8, 14, 16 GO/NO-GO gates prevent late-stage surprises
7. **Experienced Team:** Assumes senior engineers, not juniors learning on the job

**Known Unknowns (Tracked in Risk Register):**
- Dual payment gateway session management (POC Week 1-2)
- NetSuite API performance with 5,000 SKUs (POC Week 2-3)
- Japanese charset handling (POC Week 1)
- Voucherify API latency (POC Week 2-3)
- Customer data quality in legacy system (discovered during migration prep)

**Contingency Plans Ready:**
- Payment aggregator (KOMOJU/Adyen) if dual-gateway fails
- Simplified purchase limits if NetSuite too slow
- Phased launch if migration complex
- Contract resources available for overflow
