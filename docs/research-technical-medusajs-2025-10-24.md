# Technical Research Report: MedusaJS for Environ.jp E-Commerce Migration

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Prepared by:** BMad
**Project Context:** Refactoring/modernizing legacy Ruby on Rails system to production-ready MedusaJS implementation with 8-month timeline (7 months build + 1 month migration)

---

## Executive Summary

### Key Recommendation

**Primary Choice:** MedusaJS v2.0 with Custom Payment Provider Architecture

**Rationale:** MedusaJS provides a modern, headless commerce platform built on TypeScript/Node.js that addresses all critical requirements for the Environ.jp migration. The platform's modular architecture, strong community support (31K+ GitHub stars, 14K+ Discord members), and flexible extensibility make it a viable foundation for the 8-month migration timeline. However, **critical validation through the 3-week POC is mandatory** due to the dual payment gateway requirement (Stripe + RakutenPay), which represents THE highest technical unknown.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Modern Tech Stack**: TypeScript/Node.js aligns with team hiring strategy and attracts quality talent
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with Commerce Modules enables parallel stream development
- **Proven Performance**: Production deployments show 2-3x speed improvements with sub-second API response times
- **Active Ecosystem**: 14K+ Discord members, official documentation, and growing plugin marketplace
- **Low Maintenance Potential**: Headless architecture with managed integrations aligns with "set it and be done" mandate

**Critical Risks Requiring POC Validation:**
1. **Dual Payment Gateway Integration** - No evidence of production Stripe + RakutenPay implementation
2. **NetSuite Integration** - No pre-built connector; requires custom module development
3. **Subscription Billing** - Native subscription management limited; relies on Stripe Billing webhooks
4. **Third-Party Integrations** - Voucherify, Klaviyo lack official MedusaJS plugins
5. **v2.0 Stability** - Recently released (16 months development, 3,500+ PRs) with production adoption still building

---

## 1. Research Objectives

### Technical Question

Evaluate MedusaJS as the e-commerce platform for Environ.jp migration from Ruby on Rails, with focus on:
- Dual payment gateway integration (Stripe + RakutenPay)
- NetSuite integration and sync strategies
- Third-party integrations (Voucherify, Klaviyo, Algolia, Auth0/Clerk, Sanity, Canto PIM)
- Python microservices architecture for step-up program
- Performance, scalability, and PCI DSS compliance

### Project Context

**From Brainstorming Session:**
- Current system: "Burning building" with daily bugs, only "cheap companies" can maintain
- Company mandate: "Set it and be done" - low maintenance solution
- Eventual team: 4 people (1 UI, 1 BE, 1 DevOps, 1 QA)
- Timeline: Week 1-3 POC validation → Week 4-28 build → Week 29-33 migration
- Risk tolerance: Can accept tech debt, but **payments must work**

### ⚠️ CRITICAL UNKNOWNS (Require POC Validation)

#### 1. Dual Payment Gateway (HIGHEST RISK)

**Current Situation:**
- ✅ **Stripe:** Official plugin, production-ready
- ❌ **RakutenPay:** No plugin, custom development required
- ❌ **Dual Gateway:** No evidence of Stripe + Japanese konbini running simultaneously

**MedusaJS Multi-Provider Support:**
- ✅ **Confirmed:** Platform supports multiple payment providers
- Providers configured as array in medusa-config.ts
- Each region can enable different providers
- Customer selects method at checkout

**Custom RakutenPay Implementation Required:**

```typescript
// Custom Payment Module Provider
export default class RakutenPayProvider {
  async authorizePayment(paymentData) {
    // Call RakutenPay API to initialize transaction
  }

  async capturePayment(paymentData) {
    // Complete payment
  }

  async refundPayment(paymentData) {
    // Process refund
  }
}
```

**Estimated Effort:**
- POC version: 3-5 days
- Production-ready: 2-3 weeks

**CRITICAL UNKNOWN:**
- Session management with 2 gateways untested
- Payment provider switching mid-checkout unproven
- **MUST VALIDATE IN WEEK 1-2 POC**

**GO/NO-GO Criteria:**
- ✅ Customer can select Stripe OR RakutenPay
- ✅ Both complete transactions successfully
- ✅ Edge cases handled (timeouts, failures)

**Contingency if POC Fails:**
1. Use KOMOJU payment aggregator (supports both)
2. Use Adyen (research if supports both)
3. Pivot to different platform

---

#### 2. NetSuite Integration Performance

**Current Situation:**
- ❌ No pre-built MedusaJS-NetSuite connector
- ✅ Documented ERP integration pattern exists
- ⚠️ Performance with 5,000 SKU hourly sync unknown

**Integration Pattern:**

```typescript
// Custom NetSuite Module
class NetSuiteService {
  async syncProducts() {
    // 1. Authenticate with NetSuite REST API
    // 2. Fetch 5,000+ SKUs
    // 3. Map to Medusa product schema
    // 4. Upsert in database
  }

  async syncOrder(orderId) {
    // Send order to NetSuite
  }

  async getCustomerOrderHistory(customerId) {
    // Query for purchase limits
  }
}
```

**MedusaJS Workflows Support:**
- Rollback logic for failed syncs
- Async processing for heavy operations
- Queue-based job processing

**CRITICAL UNKNOWN:**
- Can NetSuite API handle hourly 5,000 SKU fetch in <2 hours?
- **MUST VALIDATE IN WEEK 2-3 POC**

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Start integration Week 4 (not Week 10)
- 10-week buffer for unknowns
- Week 14 GO/NO-GO checkpoint

**Estimated Effort:** 10 weeks (+ 2 week buffer)

---

#### 3. Japanese Market Unknown

**Findings:**
- ❌ No Japanese production case studies found
- ❌ No Japan-specific documentation
- ⚠️ Unknown if Japanese charset handled properly

**Multi-Region Support:**
- ✅ MedusaJS supports multi-currency (JPY)
- ✅ Regional pricing configuration
- ⚠️ Japanese language/charset needs testing

**POC Validation Required:**
- Japanese text input/display
- Algolia Japanese search configuration
- Payment method labels in Japanese

**Mitigation:** Test thoroughly in Week 1 POC

---

### ⚠️ CUSTOM DEVELOPMENT REQUIRED

#### 4. Third-Party Integrations

**Integration Status:**

| Service | Plugin Status | Implementation | Effort |
|---------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| **Stripe** | ✅ Official | medusa-payment-stripe | ✅ Ready |
| **RakutenPay** | ❌ None | Custom payment provider | 3 weeks |
| **NetSuite** | ❌ None | Custom ERP module | 10 weeks |
| **Voucherify** | ❌ None | Custom loyalty module | 4 weeks |
| **Klaviyo** | ⚠️ v1 only | Custom notification module | 2 weeks |
| **Algolia** | ✅ Official | medusa-plugin-algolia | ✅ Ready |
| **Auth0** | ⚠️ Community | medusa-plugin-auth | 1 week |
| **Clerk** | ❌ None | Custom auth strategy | 3 weeks |
| **Sanity** | ⚠️ Patterns | UI-direct (no backend) | ✅ Ready |
| **Canto PIM** | - | UI-direct (no backend) | ✅ Ready |

**Total Custom Development:** 17+ weeks backend effort

**Feasibility:** Fits within 25-week build (parallel streams)

---

#### 5. Voucherify Loyalty Integration

**No Official Plugin:**
- Custom module development required
- Voucherify has well-documented REST API

**Implementation Approach:**

```typescript
class LoyaltyService {
  async getCustomerPoints(customerId) {
    // Fetch from Voucherify API
  }

  async redeemPoints(customerId, points) {
    // Real-time redemption during checkout
  }
}
```

**Critical Question:**
- Can Voucherify API handle real-time checkout latency?
- **Test in POC Week 2-3**

**Estimated Effort:** 4 weeks (Week 18-22)

---

#### 6. Klaviyo Email Marketing

**Current Status:**
- medusa-plugin-klaviyo exists for v1
- v2 support in development (GitHub #9805)

**Workaround:**
- Build custom Notification Module Provider
- Use Event Module to trigger emails
- Direct Klaviyo API calls

**Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks (Week 22-24)

---

#### 7. Subscription Management Limitations

**MedusaJS v2 Subscription Support:**
- ❌ No native subscription management
- ✅ Stripe Billing integration via webhooks
- ⚠️ Subscription management in Stripe dashboard (not Medusa Admin)

**Simplified Approach:**
1. Stripe manages subscriptions
2. Webhooks create draft orders in Medusa
3. Ops team uses Stripe dashboard for subscription management

**Trade-off:**
- Pro: Leverage Stripe's robust subscription features
- Con: Two systems to manage (Medusa + Stripe dashboard)

**Mitigation:**
- Simplify MVP: Create, cancel only
- Defer advanced features (pause, scheduling) to Phase 2
- Train ops team on both systems

---

## 4. Step-Up Microservice Integration

### Python Microservice Architecture

**MedusaJS External Service Pattern:**

```typescript
// MedusaJS Integration Module
class StepUpService {
  async validatePurchase(customerId, productId, quantity) {
    // Call Python microservice
    const response = await axios.post(
      `${STEP_UP_API_URL}/validate`,
      { customer_id, product_id, quantity }
    )
    return response.data
  }
}
```

**Python Service (FastAPI):**

```python
@app.post("/validate")
async def validate_purchase(request: PurchaseValidationRequest):
    # Check customer purchase history from MedusaJS
    # Validate concentration level progression
    return {
        "allowed": True,
        "reason": "Customer eligible",
        "max_concentration": "10%"
    }
```

**Integration Points:**
1. Cart add validation (event-driven)
2. Checkout validation (workflow step)

**Communication:** REST API (simple, proven)

**Error Handling:**
- If service down: Block high-concentration purchases, allow low-concentration

**Estimated Effort:**
- Python service: 12 weeks (client engineer)
- MedusaJS integration: 1 week (Week 20)

---
