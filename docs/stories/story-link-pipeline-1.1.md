# Story 1.1: Refactor OpenRouter Client to Use OpenAI Library

Status: done

## Story

As a developer,
I want to use the official OpenAI library for OpenRouter API calls,
so that I get built-in retry logic, better error handling, and response validation.

## Context

During code review of Story 1, identified that the custom httpx-based OpenRouter client implementation has 3 LOW severity findings that would be automatically addressed by using the official OpenAI Python library (already installed in dependencies):
1. No retry logic for API calls
2. No input validation on API responses
3. Error context could be enhanced

OpenRouter is OpenAI API-compatible, so we can use the official client with just a base URL change.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. OpenRouter client uses OpenAI library instead of httpx
2. Client configured with `base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"`
3. Built-in retry logic enabled (`max_retries=3`)
4. Debug logging added for API calls (request and response metadata)
5. All existing tests pass with updated implementation
6. httpx dependency removed from pyproject.toml (if not used elsewhere)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Update `dagster_project/resources/openrouter_client.py`:
  - [x] Replace httpx imports with openai imports
  - [x] Update OpenRouterClient to use OpenAI client
  - [x] Configure base_url and max_retries in setup_for_execution
  - [x] Update chat_completion to use client.chat.completions.create
  - [x] Add debug logging: log request metadata (model, message count, temperature)
  - [x] Add debug logging: log response metadata (completion tokens, model used)
  - [x] Update get_completion_text to use OpenAI response object
- [x] Update tests:
  - [x] `tests/test_openrouter_client.py` - Update mocks for OpenAI library
  - [x] Verify all 20 tests pass (added 1 new test for OpenAI client initialization)
- [x] Remove httpx from dependencies:
  - [x] Check if httpx is used elsewhere (grep for httpx imports)
  - [x] Removed from direct dependencies (still present as transitive dependency via openai library)
- [x] Run quality checks: `make check`

## Dev Notes

### Technical Summary

Refactor OpenRouter client to use official OpenAI Python library for better reliability and maintainability. This is a drop-in replacement since OpenRouter is OpenAI API-compatible.

### Estimated Effort

0.5 story points (~15-20 minutes)

### Benefits

- ✅ Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Better error messages with request context
- ✅ Response validation and type safety
- ✅ Debug logging for API call monitoring and troubleshooting
- ✅ Visibility into token usage and model performance
- ✅ Streaming support (for future use)
- ✅ Async support (for future use)
- ✅ Less code to maintain
- ✅ Well-tested library used by thousands of projects

### Implementation Notes

**Debug Logging Example:**
```python
def chat_completion(
    self,
    context,  # Add context parameter for logging
    messages: list[dict[str, str]],
    temperature: float = 0.7,
    max_tokens: int | None = None,
    **kwargs: Any,
) -> Any:
    """Make a chat completion request to OpenRouter."""
    # Log request metadata
    context.log.debug(
        f"OpenRouter API request: model={self.model}, "
        f"messages={len(messages)}, temp={temperature}, "
        f"max_tokens={max_tokens or 'unlimited'}"
    )

    response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
        model=self.model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature,
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
        **kwargs,
    )

    # Log response metadata (token usage, model)
    context.log.debug(
        f"OpenRouter API response: model={response.model}, "
        f"completion_tokens={response.usage.completion_tokens}, "
        f"prompt_tokens={response.usage.prompt_tokens}, "
        f"total_tokens={response.usage.total_tokens}"
    )

    return response
```

**Note:** This requires passing `context` from assets to the resource method. Assets will call it as:
```python
@asset
def my_asset(context, openrouter: OpenRouterClient):
    response = openrouter.chat_completion(
        context,  # Pass context for logging
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
    )
```

### Debug Log References

**Implementation Approach:**
- Replaced httpx-based implementation with OpenAI Python library
- Used `@cached_property` pattern for OpenAI client initialization to work with Dagster's frozen ConfigurableResource
- Added context parameter to chat_completion method for debug logging

- Added new test for OpenAI client initialization parameters verification
- All 20 tests passing (originally 19, added 1 new test)
- Used patch.object to mock cached_property client for testing

**Dependency Management:**

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** BMad
**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Outcome:** ✅ **APPROVE**

### Summary

Story 1.1 successfully refactors the OpenRouter client from httpx to the official OpenAI Python library. The implementation is clean, well-tested, and demonstrates thoughtful architectural decisions (especially the `@cached_property` pattern for lazy initialization). All acceptance criteria are met, all tests pass, and the code quality is high. The implementation actually exceeds the original requirements in some areas (e.g., making base_url configurable via environment variable).

### Key Findings

**Strengths:**

1. **Architectural Excellence:** `@cached_property` pattern for OpenAI client initialization is the correct solution for Dagster's frozen ConfigurableResource - demonstrates deep understanding of Dagster's resource lifecycle
2. **Environment Configuration:** Made base_url configurable via `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` (not originally required) - good foresight for testing/flexibility
3. **Comprehensive Logging:** Debug logging covers both request metadata (model, message count, temperature) and response metadata (tokens, model) for full observability
4. **Test Quality:** Tests properly mock the @cached_property using `patch.object` - shows testing sophistication
5. **Clean Migration:** Complete removal of httpx as direct dependency while maintaining it as transitive dependency via openai library

**No HIGH or MEDIUM severity findings** - only optional advisory notes for future enhancements.

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Current Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Resource initialization
- ✅ Configuration validation (API key required)
- ✅ OpenAI client initialization parameters
- ✅ chat_completion request structure
- ✅ Debug logging verification (request + response)
- ✅ get_completion_text response parsing
- ✅ Integration test for base_url configuration

**Test Gaps (Optional):**
- Error handling tests (OpenAI API errors, network failures)
- Retry behavior verification (mock failures to test max_retries)
- Timeout behavior testing

**Assessment:** Current test coverage is adequate for the story scope. Additional tests would be valuable but are not blocking.

### Architectural Alignment

✅ **Full alignment with Dagster best practices**
- ConfigurableResource pattern correctly implemented
- Field with default_factory for environment variables
- @cached_property for lazy initialization of stateful objects
- Context-based logging integration

✅ **Full alignment with OpenRouter integration requirements**
- base_url correctly configured for OpenRouter API compatibility
- max_retries=3 for resilience
- Model configuration via environment variable

✅ **Full alignment with tech spec**
- Maintains all existing functionality
- Enhances retry logic (Dagster + OpenAI library)
- Adds debug logging for better observability
- No architectural violations

### Security Notes

| Risk Category | Finding | Severity |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| Secret Management | API key loaded from environment | ✅ SAFE |
| Input Validation | Messages parameter not validated before API call | ⚠️ LOW |
| Error Handling | Relies on OpenAI library error handling | ✅ ADEQUATE |
| Dependency Security | OpenAI library is well-maintained, official SDK | ✅ SAFE |
| Logging | Logs metadata only (no message content) | ✅ SAFE |

**Notes:**
- **LOW**: No explicit validation of `messages` structure before API call. OpenAI library will validate, but custom checks could provide better error messages.

### Action Items

**Code Changes Required:**
*None - all acceptance criteria met, implementation is production-ready.*

**Advisory Notes:**
- Note: Consider adding `from openai.types.chat import ChatCompletion` type hint for chat_completion return type (improves IDE autocomplete and type checking)
- Note: Could add explicit messages validation for better error messages (OpenAI library handles this, but custom validation would provide clearer errors)
- Note: Consider adding request timing metrics (e.g., time.time() before/after API call) for performance monitoring in production
- Note: Document retry and timeout behavior in class docstring for future developers
