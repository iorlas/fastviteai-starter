# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** October 24, 2025
**Facilitator:** Elite Brainstorming Specialist Carson
**Participant:** BMad

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Environ.jp E-Commerce Backend Rewrite: Delivery Estimation & Risk-Aware Strategy for MedusaJS Migration with Parallel 2-Stream Delivery

**Session Goals:** Build a comprehensive delivery estimation for migrating environ.jp from Ruby on Rails to MedusaJS, structured as parallel 2-stream delivery. Create a risks registry, identify open questions and dependencies, and develop a risks-aware delivery strategy through deep-dive analysis to avoid gaps.

**Techniques Used:** Mind Mapping (Structured), Question Storming (Deep), Six Thinking Hats (Structured), Morphological Analysis (Deep)

**Total Ideas Generated:** 200+ questions, 40+ risks identified, 4 platform options evaluated, 4 stream split options analyzed, 1 comprehensive delivery strategy designed

### Key Themes Identified:

1. **Platform Choice is THE Critical Decision** - MedusaJS vs. Shopify vs. WooCommerce vs. Saleor requires early validation (Week 1-3 POC) before committing team and timeline

2. **Dual Payment Gateway Integration is the Biggest Technical Unknown** - Whether MedusaJS/Shopify/WooCommerce can handle Stripe + RakutenPay simultaneously is unproven and must be validated in POC phase

3. **NetSuite is the Silent Killer** - Known to be slow, external dependency, data quality concerns, and must start integration Week 4 (not Week 10) with 10-week buffer

4. **"Set It and Be Done" Mandate** - Company is retail (not software), CTO wants low-maintenance solution, eventual team of 4 people (1 UI, 1 BE, 1 DevOps, 1 QA)

5. **Migration is Scarier Than Building** - Customer migration, subscription cutover, data quality, and ops team training require dedicated 5-week phase (not rushed)

6. **Current Legacy System is a Burning Building** - Daily firefighting, hidden bugs, unmaintainable, only "cheap companies" can support it - this is a rescue mission, not just a migration

7. **Critical Success Criteria Non-Negotiable** - Payments must work, performance must match/beat current, admin UI must be usable by ops team, checkout must be more stable than legacy

## Technique Sessions

### Session 1: Mind Mapping (Structured) - 45 minutes

**Objective:** Map the entire system architecture, integration dependencies, and identify natural boundaries for parallel delivery streams.

**Central Concept:** Environ.jp MedusaJS Migration

**Major Branches Explored:**

1. **Technical Foundation**
   - MedusaJS core (version selection, customization capabilities, extension architecture)
   - Infrastructure (hosting, PostgreSQL, Redis, static site builds)
   - API architecture (REST endpoints, adapters - later removed from scope)
   - DevOps & CI/CD

2. **External Integrations** (9 major systems identified)
   - NetSuite (system of record - orders, inventory, product restrictions)
   - Canto PIM (product data pulled to UI directly, NOT via MedusaJS backend)
   - Payment: Stripe (primary) + RakutenPay (konbini, potentially separate gateway)
   - Voucherify (loyalty points, tier status, promotions)
   - Klaviyo (marketing/transactional emails)
   - Algolia (product search)
   - Auth0/Clerk (identity, social login)
   - Sanity CMS (static content, UI texts)

3. **Functional Modules** (12 modules mapped from project docs)
   - Essentials, Catalog, Step-Up & Status, Search, Authentication
   - Cart & Marketing, Recommendations, Checkout & Payments
   - Subscriptions, Store Finder & NAVI, NetSuite integration, Stabilization

4. **Data & Migration**
   - Rails database export, data mapping, user migration
   - Order history, subscription migration (legacy parallel operation)
   - NetSuite synchronization logic (hourly orders, inventory pull-back)

5. **Team & Resources**
   - 2 React engineers, 1 team lead, 1 DevOps, 2-3 backend engineers
   - 2 QA testers, client Python engineer (part-time for step-up microservice)
   - Hiring flexibility: TypeScript, Python, or PHP

6. **Delivery Strategy** (initial exploration, refined in Morphological Analysis)
   - Timeline: 6-8 months target (7 months build + 1 month migration)
   - 2-stream parallel approach (to be defined)
   - Progressive releases, legacy parallel operation

**Key Insights from Mind Mapping:**
- **Integration Hell Alert:** 9 external systems must play nicely together
- **Unclear Requirements:** Step-up rules, Voucherify point expiry (later clarified)
- **Data Sync Complexity:** NetSuite is source of truth but pulling from multiple systems
- **Module Interdependencies:** Cart depends on Auth, Catalog, NetSuite limits
- **Timeline Math:** 12 modules × 2 months sequential = 24 months → 2-stream parallelization CRITICAL

### Session 2: Question Storming (Deep) - 30 minutes

**Objective:** Generate comprehensive open questions registry before seeking answers. Identify every unknown, assumption, gap, and decision point.

**Technique Rules:** No answers allowed, quantity over quality, build on questions, no judgment.

**Question Categories Generated (~200 questions):**

**1. NetSuite Sync Strategy & Data Integrity (25 questions)**
- How often should inventory sync from NetSuite to MedusaJS?

- What would cause us to call this project a failure?
- What's minimum viable product we'd be comfortable launching?
- What features delay to month 8+ rather than delay launch?
- How much technical debt willing to accept to hit 7 months?
- Can we launch with known bugs if low-priority?
- What's worse - launching month 8 with everything or month 7 with 80%?

**Critical Open Questions Requiring POC/Research:**
1. Can chosen platform handle dual payment gateways (Stripe + RakutenPay)?
2. Can NetSuite API handle hourly bulk product fetches (5,000+ SKUs)?
3. Can Voucherify API handle real-time point redemption during checkout?
4. Is RakutenPay API well-documented for custom integration?
5. Can MedusaJS reliably handle Stripe subscription webhooks?

### Session 3: Six Thinking Hats (Structured) - 40 minutes

**Objective:** Analyze project from six distinct perspectives to build comprehensive risk registry and identify opportunities.

**⚪ White Hat (Facts & Data):**
- Current system: Ruby on Rails (legacy, "more or less stable" but hidden bugs daily)
- Timeline: 8 months including migration (hard deadline)
- Team: 2 React, 1 lead, 1 DevOps, 2-3 backend, 2 QA
- Can hire: TypeScript, Python, OR PHP engineers
- NetSuite: Already integrated, known slow, must remain system of record
- Python microservices: Already exist (skin check, recommendations), will add step-up
- Client engineer: Available for Python microservice development
- Required integrations: NetSuite, Stripe, RakutenPay, Voucherify, Klaviyo, Algolia, Auth0/Clerk, Sanity, Canto PIM
- React UI: Will adapt to new APIs (no adapter layer)
- Cannot skip functionality except minor details
- Can tolerate tech debt and launch with bugs (1-2 month fix window)
- **PCI DSS compliance required** (payment data security)

**🔴 Red Hat (Gut Feelings & Intuition):**
- **Fears:** RakutenPay multi-gateway integration is BIG unknown, WooCommerce plugin forking risk, hidden blockers won't surface until month 3-4
- **Excitement:** Ditching legacy system, "set it and be done" low-maintenance
- **Intuitions:**
  - WooCommerce does NOT feel safe (PHP/plugins dated, CTO's proof is much simpler storefront)
  - MedusaJS feels modern and right BUT risk is Stripe/payment integration
  - RakutenPay question is THE critical unknown
  - Shopify + dual gateways might be trouble
- **The Real Driver:** Current legacy has hidden bugs EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS - no one wants to support it, only "cheap companies" can maintain it

**🟡 Yellow Hat (Benefits & Opportunities):**
- **Primary Benefit:** ESCAPE THE NIGHTMARE - end daily firefighting, eliminate mystery bugs
- Simplified maintainable codebase (ditch legacy complexity)
- Smaller long-term team (4 people vs. current 8)
- Modern integrations delegate to SaaS (less custom code)
- Modern tech stack attracts quality talent (vs. "cheap companies only")
- Team morale boost (no one wants to touch current system)
- Better performance potential
- More stable checkout (eliminate random legacy bugs)
- Clean slate - rebuild architecture properly
- Data quality improvement during migration

**⚫ Black Hat (Risks & Problems) - COMPREHENSIVE RISK REGISTRY:**

**CRITICAL RISKS (Show-Stoppers):**

1. **Platform Choice Goes Wrong (Severity: CRITICAL)**
   - Pick MedusaJS → discover platform can't handle dual gateways → forced rebuild month 3
   - Pick Shopify → discover RakutenPay integration impossible → lose Japanese payment
   - Pick WooCommerce → hit plugin extensibility wall → forced to fork/maintain custom PHP
   - **Mitigation:** 3-week POC with dual gateway test BEFORE committing

2. **RakutenPay Integration Failure (Severity: CRITICAL)**
   - Platform cannot handle Stripe + RakutenPay in same checkout
   - Multiple gateway orchestration breaks checkout flow
   - Customer session management breaks with 2 gateways
   - Payment provider switching mid-checkout causes state issues
   - **Mitigation:** RakutenPay sandbox available Day 1 (legacy system), test in POC Week 1-3

3. **NetSuite Integration Catastrophe (Severity: CRITICAL)**
   - NetSuite API slower than expected → hourly sync takes 3+ hours
   - NetSuite data quality issues during migration (corrupted data)
   - Sync job fails silently → customers buy out-of-stock items
   - Purchase limit logic breaks (NetSuite vs. new system disagree on order history)
   - NetSuite team doesn't cooperate with API access (external dependency)
   - **Mitigation:** Start NetSuite integration Week 4 (not Week 10), 10-week buffer

4. **Migration Disaster (Severity: CRITICAL)**
   - Customer migration fails → lose customer data
   - Active subscriptions break during cutover → angry customers
   - Order history doesn't migrate correctly → customer service nightmare
   - Migration takes longer than expected → extended downtime
   - Rollback fails → stuck in broken state
   - **Mitigation:** Dedicated 5-week migration phase (not rushed), test migrations on staging

5. **Payment Failure at Launch (Severity: CRITICAL)**
   - Payment gateway down during launch
   - PCI DSS compliance gap discovered post-launch → forced to take site down
   - Refund flow breaks → cannot process returns
   - Edge case payment scenarios untested
   - **Mitigation:** 8-week payment integration with buffer, PCI compliance review Week 14-15

6. **Performance Degradation (Severity: CRITICAL)**
   - New system slower than legacy → customer complaints
   - Checkout page load >5 seconds → cart abandonment
   - Complex business rules add too much latency
   - Database queries poorly optimized
   - NetSuite API calls block page renders
   - **Mitigation:** Load testing Week 25-26, performance optimization Week 25-28

**HIGH RISKS (Significant Impact, Mitigation Possible):**

7. **Timeline Overrun**
   - Month 3: Discover platform limitation → 2 months to fix
   - Python microservice delayed → blocks testing/launch
   - Integration debugging takes 2x longer than estimated
   - Team learning curve steeper than expected
   - **Mitigation:** Strategic buffers (NetSuite +2 weeks, payments +1 week, migration +1 week)

8. **Admin UI Rejection by Ops Team**
   - Ops team cannot figure out new admin → revolt
   - Critical workflows missing → ops blocks launch
   - Reports/dashboards don't exist → manual work increases
   - **Mitigation:** Ops training Week 25-26, admin customization Week 22-24

9. **Team/Hiring Risks**
   - Cannot hire quality backend engineers in time
   - Key engineer quits mid-project
   - Client Python engineer delays/underdelivers
   - **Mitigation:** Start hiring immediately, contract MedusaJS expert for first 2 months

10. **Integration Hell**
    - Voucherify API too slow for real-time checkout
    - Klaviyo integration breaks email flows
    - Algolia doesn't handle Japanese well
    - Auth0/Clerk social login breaks
    - **Mitigation:** Integration testing Week 24, parallel integration work in Stream 2

11. **Technical Debt Spiral**
    - Rush to meet deadline → massive tech debt
    - "1-2 month bug fix" becomes 6 months
    - System becomes "new legacy" faster than expected
    - **Mitigation:** Accept tech debt as tradeoff, plan 1-2 month stabilization post-launch

12. **Business Logic Bugs**
    - Purchase limits don't work → customers bypass restrictions
    - Step-up program lets customers buy wrong products → health/safety issue
    - Loyalty points calculated incorrectly
    - Subscription billing errors → revenue loss
    - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing, edge case coverage, QA team throughout

**MEDIUM RISKS (Manageable):**
- Scope creep (stakeholders add features mid-project)
- Frontend/backend team coordination issues
- DevOps setup delayed
- Environment mismatch (staging vs. production)

**🟢 Green Hat (Creative Alternatives & Options):**

**Platform Options Evaluated:**
1. MedusaJS - Modern, flexible, requires custom dual-gateway work
2. Shopify Plus - Managed, fast, verify dual-gateway support
3. WooCommerce - CTO knows it, PHP dated, plugin extensibility risk
4. Saleor - Python/Django, team can hire Python devs
5. Hybrid - MedusaJS core + custom payment orchestrator microservice

**Payment Strategy Options:**
1. Launch Stripe-only → Add RakutenPay Phase 2 (6 weeks post-launch)
2. Build custom payment orchestrator microservice
3. Research payment aggregators (Adyen, others supporting both?)

**Risk Mitigation Creative Options:**
1. Week 1-3 POCs → Test platform + dual gateway BEFORE committing
2. Parallel platform evaluation → 2 teams test MedusaJS vs. Shopify simultaneously
3. Phased launch → New customers first, migrate existing later

**Delivery Strategy (User's Creative Idea):**
- **Month 1-7: Build complete system** (feature-complete, tested, ready)
- **Month 8: Migration phase** (cutover, data migration, customer migration)
- **Benefit:** Separates "build" from "migrate" → cleaner milestones
- **Stakeholder messaging:** "Product ready month 7, live month 8"

**RakutenPay Non-Negotiable Strategy:**
- Must integrate EARLY (Week 2-3 POC) to surface risks immediately
- Cannot defer to Phase 2 - launch requirement
- Test dual-gateway flow in POC

**🔵 Blue Hat (Process & Planning):**

**Recommended Validation Phase:** 3 weeks (User decision)
- Week 1-2: MedusaJS + dual gateway POC (Stripe + RakutenPay)
- Week 2-3: NetSuite sync POC (parallel)
- Week 3: Platform GO/NO-GO decision
- By end Week 3: Architecture finalized, ready to build

**Overall Process:**
- Week 1-3: Validation/POC (3 weeks)
- Week 4-28: Build phase - 2 parallel streams (25 weeks)
- Week 29-33: Migration & launch (5 weeks with buffer)
- **Total: 33 weeks (7.6 months)** ✅

**Critical Checkpoints:**
- Week 3: Platform GO/NO-GO decision
- Week 8: Foundation stable (MedusaJS, auth, DevOps)
- Week 14: NetSuite integration working (GO/NO-GO)
- Week 16: Payment gateways functional (CRITICAL checkpoint)
- Week 22: Step-up microservice integrated
- Week 24: Full integration testing
- Week 28: Feature-complete system
- Week 33: Launch

### Session 4: Morphological Analysis (Deep) - 35 minutes

**Objective:** Systematically explore ALL possible combinations for 2-stream parallel delivery to maximize velocity and hit 7-month build target (25 weeks).

**Parameter 1: Stream Split Options Evaluated**

**Option A: Frontend vs. Backend**
- Stream 1 (Frontend): React UI, static builds, product pages, checkout UI
- Stream 2 (Backend): MedusaJS core, integrations, APIs, business logic
- Pros: Clear ownership, minimal coordination
- Cons: Frontend blocked waiting for APIs
- **Verdict:** Too sequential, doesn't maximize parallelization

**Option B: Feature-Based Vertical Slices**
- Stream 1: Catalog + Search + Product Pages (end-to-end)
- Stream 2: Checkout + Payments + Subscriptions (end-to-end)
- Pros: Each stream delivers complete features
- Cons: More coordination, shared services
- **Verdict:** Good but risk unbalanced (Stream 2 has all high-risk items)

**Option C: Foundation vs. Features**
- Stream 1 (Foundation): MedusaJS, NetSuite, Auth, Core APIs, Infrastructure
- Stream 2 (Features): Business logic, integrations, Python microservices
- Pros: Stream 1 unblocks Stream 2, clear phases
- Cons: Stream 2 waits initially
- **Verdict:** Solid approach but can improve with risk focus

**Option D: High-Risk vs. Low-Risk** ✅ SELECTED
- Stream 1 (High-Risk): Payments, NetSuite, RakutenPay, Voucherify (critical path)
- Stream 2 (Low-Risk): Search, CMS, Klaviyo, UI polish
- Pros: Focus on risk mitigation early, parallel independent work
- Cons: Unbalanced workload (acceptable tradeoff)
- **Verdict:** BEST CHOICE - tackles unknowns early, Stream 2 can work independently

**Parameter 2: Team Composition Per Stream**

**User Preference:** Split UI engineers between streams (cross-functional teams)
- Each stream = 1 UI engineer + backend engineers
- End-to-end feature ownership
- Minimizes dependencies between streams

**✅ FINAL SELECTION:**
- **Stream 1:** 1 UI + 2 BE + DevOps (shared) + Team Lead (oversight)
- **Stream 2:** 1 UI + 1 BE + Client Python Engineer (part-time)

**Parameter 3: Strategic Buffers**

**Critical Buffers Added:**
1. NetSuite Integration: +2 weeks (8 weeks → 10 weeks)
   - Why: Slow, unknown data quality, external dependency
2. Payment Gateways: +1 week (7 weeks → 8 weeks)
   - Why: Dual gateway unproven, RakutenPay custom implementation
3. Migration Phase: +1 week (4 weeks → 5 weeks)
   - Why: Customer migration high-risk, cannot rush

**Total Timeline:** 33 weeks (7.6 months) - fits 8-month target ✅

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities

_Actions ready to implement now (Week 1-4)_

1. **Launch 3-Week POC Validation Phase**

1. **Advanced Subscription Features** (Month 9-10)
   - Subscription pause/resume
   - Schedule delivery to specific date
   - Multi-frequency options (weekly, quarterly)
   - Subscription gifting
   - **Rationale:** MVP launches with basic monthly subscriptions + cancel only

2. **Enhanced Step-Up Program Logic** (Month 9-11)
   - Time-based progression tracking (X months at lower concentration)
   - Purchase count requirements (Y purchases before upgrade)
   - Automated email notifications for step-up eligibility
   - **Rationale:** MVP launches with basic concentration-level validation only

   - Monetize the pain of legacy migration

3. **Blockchain-Based Loyalty Program**
   - NFT-based tier status and rewards
   - Cryptocurrency point redemption
   - Decentralized customer data ownership
   - Cross-brand loyalty network

4. **Fully Automated Operations**
   - AI customer service chatbot (reduce ops team load)
   - Automated inventory forecasting (NetSuite integration)
   - Zero-touch order fulfillment
   - Target: Reduce eventual team from 4 to 2 people

### Insights and Learnings

_Key realizations from the session_

1. **The Real Problem is Legacy Pain, Not Features**
   - Hidden bugs every couple of days, firefighting mode
   - Only "cheap companies" can maintain current system
   - Team morale suffering, quality talent won't touch it
   - **Insight:** This is a rescue mission - speed matters, but stability matters MORE

2. **Platform Choice Risk is Greater Than Feature Risk**
   - Discovering MedusaJS can't handle dual gateways at Month 3 = project failure
   - 3-week POC is non-negotiable investment
   - GO/NO-GO decision is THE critical checkpoint
   - **Insight:** Validate platform BEFORE committing team/budget, not after

3. **NetSuite is the Silent Killer**
   - External dependency, known slow, can't control
   - Must start Week 4 (not Week 10) with 10-week buffer
   - Sync failures = customer-facing disasters (out-of-stock purchases)
   - **Insight:** Treat NetSuite as highest-risk integration, not "just another API"

4. **Low Maintenance > Flexibility**
   - Company is retail, not software (CTO mandate: "set it and be done")
   - Eventual team of 4 people must maintain this
   - Custom code = future maintenance burden
   - **Insight:** Choose managed services over custom flexibility wherever possible

5. **Migration Deserves Dedicated Phase**
   - Customer migration, subscriptions, data quality all high-risk
   - Ops team training can't be rushed
   - 5-week dedicated phase (not "squeeze into build")
   - **Insight:** Separate "product ready" (Month 7) from "customers live" (Month 8)

6. **Cross-Functional Streams Beat Layer-Based Split**
   - Each stream having UI + BE reduces dependencies
   - Vertical feature slices deliver end-to-end value
   - High-risk vs. low-risk split allows parallel independent work
   - **Insight:** Traditional "frontend team vs. backend team" would create bottlenecks

7. **Dual Payment Gateway is THE Unknown**
   - Not "does Stripe work" - "does PLATFORM handle TWO gateways"
   - RakutenPay non-negotiable for Japanese market (konbini)
   - Must validate in POC Week 1-2
   - **Insight:** Payment is both critical success criteria AND biggest technical unknown

8. **Technical Debt is Acceptable Tradeoff**
   - Can launch with bugs if low-priority
   - 1-2 month stabilization post-launch is acceptable
   - Speed > perfection (escaping burning building)
   - **Insight:** Better to have "good enough" modern system than "perfect" legacy nightmare

9. **Buffers Must Go Where Unknowns Live**
   - NetSuite: +2 weeks (slow, external, data quality unknown)
   - Payments: +1 week (dual gateway unproven)
   - Migration: +1 week (customer data too important to rush)
   - **Insight:** Don't spread buffers evenly - concentrate on highest-risk items

10. **Client Engineer as Parallel Workstream is Force Multiplier**
    - Python step-up microservice can happen independently
    - Doesn't block or depend on main platform work
    - Clear API contract at Week 3, then parallel development
    - **Insight:** Existing client resources + clear requirements = free parallel capacity

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Execute 3-Week POC Validation Phase (IMMEDIATE - Week 1-3)

**Rationale:**
Platform choice is THE critical decision. Discovering MedusaJS (or any platform) cannot handle dual payment gateways or NetSuite integration at Month 3 would force complete rebuild and blow the timeline. The 3-week POC validates both critical unknowns BEFORE committing team and budget. This is non-negotiable risk mitigation.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Week 1, Day 1-2:** Set up MedusaJS development environment (Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis)
2. **Week 1, Day 3-5:** Integrate Stripe official plugin + basic checkout flow test
3. **Week 1-2:** Build custom RakutenPay payment provider (3-5 days estimated)
4. **Week 2:** Test dual-gateway checkout flow - customer selects payment method, both gateways work
5. **Week 2-3 (Parallel):** NetSuite API POC - authenticate, pull 5,000+ SKUs, benchmark sync time
6. **Week 3, Day 1-2:** Analyze results, document findings
7. **Week 3, Day 3:** GO/NO-GO decision meeting with stakeholders
8. **Week 3, Day 4-5:** If NO-GO: Evaluate Shopify Plus or Saleor; If GO: Finalize architecture and sprint planning

**Resources Needed:**
- 1 senior backend engineer (can be contract/consultant with MedusaJS experience)
- RakutenPay sandbox credentials (available from legacy system)
- NetSuite API credentials and sandbox access
- AWS/GCP environment for POC hosting (~$100-200 budget)
- MedusaJS documentation, Stripe documentation, RakutenPay API docs

**Timeline:** Week 1-3 (15 working days)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Both Stripe AND RakutenPay work in checkout flow
- ✅ NetSuite sync completes 5,000 SKUs in <2 hours
- ✅ Platform architecture supports all business logic requirements
- ✅ Clear GO/NO-GO decision with documented justification

---

#### #2 Priority: Start NetSuite Integration Week 4 (Not Week 10) - HIGH RISK MITIGATION

**Rationale:**
NetSuite is the silent killer - external dependency, known to be slow, data quality unknown, and customer-facing disasters (out-of-stock purchases) if sync fails. Starting Week 4 with 10-week buffer (vs. typical Week 10 start) gives time to discover and resolve issues before they block launch. This is the highest-risk integration and must be de-risked early.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Week 4:** NetSuite API authentication and basic product data pull (batch job structure)
2. **Week 5-6:** Implement hourly product/inventory sync (5,000+ SKUs)
3. **Week 7-8:** Implement order sync TO NetSuite (create sales orders in NetSuite)
4. **Week 9-10:** Purchase limit enforcement (query NetSuite for customer order history)
5. **Week 11-12:** Error handling, retry logic, data conflict resolution
6. **Week 12-13:** Monitoring, alerting, logging, performance optimization
7. **Week 14:** CHECKPOINT - NetSuite integration complete OR escalate to stakeholders

**Resources Needed:**
- 1 senior backend engineer dedicated to NetSuite (entire 10 weeks)
- NetSuite API documentation and support contact
- NetSuite sandbox environment for testing
- Data mapping documentation (Rails schema → NetSuite schema)
- Monitoring/observability tools (DataDog, New Relic, or similar)

**Timeline:** Week 4-14 (10 weeks with +2 week buffer)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Hourly sync completes 5,000+ SKUs in <2 hours reliably
- ✅ Order sync to NetSuite <5 min from checkout completion
- ✅ Purchase limits correctly enforced (query NetSuite history)
- ✅ Error handling prevents silent failures
- ✅ Monitoring alerts on sync failures within 5 minutes

**Contingency Plan:**
If Week 12 checkpoint shows NetSuite integration failing:
- Option A: Extend buffer to Week 16 (use 2 weeks from other areas)
- Option B: Simplify purchase limits to MedusaJS-only (sacrifice accuracy for launch)
- Option C: Delay launch OR reduce NetSuite dependency (high-risk)

#### #3 Priority: Build Payment Gateways (Stripe + RakutenPay) Week 8-16 - CRITICAL PATH

**Rationale:**
Payment failure at launch = project failure. This is non-negotiable success criteria. Dual gateway integration is technically unproven (validated in POC but building production-ready is different). RakutenPay is non-negotiable for Japanese market (konbini payments). 8-week timeline with +1 week buffer ensures production-ready, PCI-compliant, edge-case-tested payment flow. This is on the critical path and cannot slip.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Week 8-10:** Stripe integration (official plugin + customization for subscriptions)
2. **Week 10-13:** RakutenPay custom payment provider (production-ready, not POC quality)
3. **Week 11-13:** Dual-gateway checkout orchestration (payment method selection, session management)
4. **Week 13-14:** Payment webhooks (success, failure, refund handling)
5. **Week 14-15:** PCI DSS compliance review and security audit
6. **Week 15:** Edge case testing (timeouts, retries, partial failures, gateway downtime)
7. **Week 16:** CHECKPOINT - Both gateways production-ready OR escalate

**Resources Needed:**
- 1 senior backend engineer (payments specialist if possible)
- 1 UI engineer (checkout UI, payment method selection)
- Stripe production account + RakutenPay production credentials
- PCI compliance consultant or audit service
- Payment testing tools (Stripe test mode, RakutenPay sandbox)
- QA engineer for edge case testing

**Timeline:** Week 8-16 (8 weeks with +1 week buffer)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Stripe payments work for one-time purchases + subscriptions
- ✅ RakutenPay konbini payments work end-to-end
- ✅ Customer can choose payment method at checkout
- ✅ Refund flow works for both gateways
- ✅ PCI DSS compliant (no raw card data storage, tokenization working)
- ✅ Payment reconciliation reports accurate
- ✅ Edge cases handled (gateway downtime = graceful failure, not crash)

**Contingency Plan:**
If Week 15 shows dual-gateway not working:
- Option A: Launch Stripe-only, add RakutenPay Phase 2 (6 weeks post-launch) - **HIGH RISK** (Japanese customers need konbini)
- Option B: Use payment aggregator (Adyen) if supports both - research during POC
- Option C: Extend timeline to Week 18 (+2 weeks) - eats into other areas

## Reflection and Follow-up

### What Worked Well

1. **Mind Mapping Revealed Integration Complexity**
   - Visualizing 9 external integrations made the "integration hell" risk concrete
   - Mapping dependencies clarified why 2-stream parallelization is critical
   - Identified that 12 modules × 2 months = 24 months sequential → parallelization mandatory

2. **Question Storming Generated Comprehensive Registry**
   - 200+ questions captured every unknown and assumption
   - "No answers allowed" rule forced systematic exploration
   - Critical questions requiring POC emerged clearly (dual gateway, NetSuite performance)

3. **Six Thinking Hats Uncovered Real Motivations**
   - Red Hat revealed "burning building" reality (daily bugs, only cheap companies maintain)
   - Black Hat built actionable risk registry with mitigation strategies
   - Yellow Hat clarified primary benefit is "escape nightmare" not "add features"
   - Blue Hat designed practical 3-week POC validation approach

4. **Morphological Analysis Converged on Best Strategy**
   - Evaluating 4 stream split options systematically led to clear winner (High-Risk vs. Low-Risk)
   - Cross-functional streams (UI + BE per stream) reduces dependencies
   - Strategic buffer placement (NetSuite +2, Payments +1, Migration +1) concentrates on unknowns

5. **Technical Evaluation Agent Delivered Actionable Analysis**
   - MedusaJS evaluation provided realistic timeline (34-47 weeks), not optimistic guess
   - Plugin ecosystem gaps clearly identified (no Voucherify, NetSuite, Stripe Billing plugins)
   - Platform comparison table gave alternatives if MedusaJS fails POC

6. **User Engagement & Clarifications Shaped Strategy**
   - "API adapter layer not needed" saved 2-3 weeks
   - "7 months build + 1 month migration" reframing improved stakeholder messaging
   - "RakutenPay non-negotiable" forced dual-gateway validation into POC
   - "Low maintenance > flexibility" clarified platform selection criteria

### Areas for Further Exploration

1. **Payment Aggregator Research** (Week 1 of POC)
   - Investigate Adyen, Checkout.com for Stripe + RakutenPay support
   - Could simplify dual-gateway integration
   - Compare cost vs. custom dual-gateway implementation

2. **Shopify Plus as MedusaJS Alternative** (Contingency Planning)
   - If MedusaJS POC fails dual-gateway test
   - Research Shopify app ecosystem for RakutenPay
   - Evaluate Shopify Scripts/Functions for complex business logic (purchase limits, step-up)

3. **NetSuite Data Quality Assessment** (Week 2-3 of POC)
   - What's the real state of product data in NetSuite?
   - Are there data cleanup requirements before migration?
   - Historical order data completeness for purchase limits

4. **Ops Team Workflows Documentation** (Week 4-8)
   - Shadow ops team for 1 week to understand daily workflows
   - Document critical admin tasks that MUST work in new system
   - Identify reports/dashboards needed for Day 1

5. **Customer Migration Strategy Details** (Month 5-6)
   - How many customers? How many active subscriptions?
   - Password migration strategy (reset vs. credential transfer)
   - Communication plan for customer cutover
   - Rollback procedures if migration fails

6. **Step-Up Program Business Rules Finalization** (Week 3)
   - What are EXACT concentration thresholds?
   - Time-based OR purchase-count OR both for progression?
   - Edge cases (customer purchased before, coming back after gap)

7. **Voucherify Point Expiry Rules** (Week 8-10)
   - Does Voucherify handle expiry automatically?
   - Do we need to implement expiry logic in MedusaJS?
   - What's customer communication for expiring points?

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

1. **Pre-Mortem Analysis** (Week 3 - before GO decision)
   - Assume project failed at Month 6 - why did it fail?
   - Identify failure modes we haven't anticipated
   - Add mitigations before starting build phase

2. **Dependency Mapping** (Week 4 - start of build)
   - Map critical path dependencies between Stream 1 and Stream 2
   - Identify handoff points where streams must synchronize
   - Build Gantt chart showing parallel work and sync points

3. **Risk Retrospectives** (Every 2 weeks during build)
   - Which risks materialized? Which didn't?
   - Update risk registry as new information emerges
   - Adjust mitigation strategies based on actual experience

4. **Ops Team Design Thinking Workshop** (Month 5)
   - Collaborate with ops team on admin UI design
   - Journey map their daily workflows
   - Co-create reports and dashboards they need

### Questions That Emerged

**New Questions from This Session:**

1. **How do we coordinate handoffs between Stream 1 and Stream 2?**
   - Week 8: Auth APIs ready → Stream 2 integrates
   - Week 10: Product/cart APIs → Stream 2 switches from mocks
   - Week 15: Checkout APIs → Stream 2 builds UI
   - **Need:** Weekly sync meetings between streams

2. **What's the QA testing strategy across 2 streams?**
   - Do QA engineers test Stream 1 first, then Stream 2?
   - Or do they test continuously across both?
   - When does full integration testing start? (Week 24 suggested)

3. **How do we handle MedusaJS version selection?**
   - v1.x (stable) vs. v2.0 (rewrite, more features, less battle-tested)?
   - POC should test chosen version
   - Version upgrade path if v2.0 releases during project?

4. **What's the disaster recovery plan for launch?**
   - If payments fail Week 29, do we delay or rollback?
   - Can we run new system + old system in parallel for 1 week?
   - What's the "abort launch" criteria?

5. **How do we measure success post-launch?**
   - Payment success rate (must be >99.5%?)
   - Page load time (must be < current system?)
   - Customer satisfaction (NPS survey?)
   - Ops team productivity (time to process order?)
