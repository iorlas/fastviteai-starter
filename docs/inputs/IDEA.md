I wanna build a starter project template which will have best practices enabled for AI-assisted development.
It should be based on Claude code first and foremost. It is supposed to be catered to claude code comfort - everything is obvious, everything just works

I want it to use spec kit as a base line. A few scripts to simplify the work, readme file.
Also, it should use devcontainers.

This project will have a kickstarter boilerplate for ReactJS + Vite and Python + FastAPI. 

I really want to use devcontainers, but have no clue how to make it. There is an official guide - https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/devcontainer
But it's dockerimage uses outdated nodejs and it has no python. I wonder what is an ideomatic approach to it.
