LLM estimated it as:
  - Before: 10 story points (~1-2 weeks)
  - After: 7 story points (~3-5 days)



  Next Steps:

  1. Review the generated sprint-status.yaml - All 3 stories are marked as drafted
  2. Create story context - Run /bmad:bmm:workflows:story-context for a story to move it to ready-for-dev
  3. Start development - Run /bmad:bmm:workflows:dev-story to implement a story
  4. Track progress - Agents will automatically update statuses as they work
  5. Re-run this workflow - To refresh auto-detected statuses at any time
