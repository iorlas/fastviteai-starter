# Constitution

This is a doctrine, non-negotiatable rules

## Python
- No doc-strings. We don't need it at this stage
- Avoid creating __init__.py files creation unless it is really beneficial
- Integration tests only, while ensuring folders structure helps find it easy - tests path has relation to the module/file we test
- Pydantic instead of dataclasses
- No ad-hoc python running - use unit or integration tests if it is necessary
- run `make check` - after every significant change for sure - check and fix it. Need to ignore a rule - ask me about it first
- use context7 at planning and analysis to prepare for stuff. Use it also when you are in trouble
